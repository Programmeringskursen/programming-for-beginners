Hi!

Never programmed before? Wondering how anyone could throw a forum or a voting site together over a weekend? Curious how all these computer controlled devices around you actually work?

Then this course is for you!

Prerequisite knowledge: Absolutely none! Nada. Null. Zilch.

Gear: Bring a lapto and a USB memmory. If you have an Apple computer (Mac): Try to borrow a PC from someone. Alternatively you can install Ubuntu Linux youself before the course, either to a USB memory or to the hard drive of your Mac.

What you get to learn: What programming really is, to write code in the language Python and to build a larger program together with other people.

Who we are:

Egil MÃ¶ller: Has been working as a free softare programmerfor about 13 years. Currently working for skytruth.org (an environmental non-profit) analyzing satellite data.

Saghar Asadi:

Food: Potluck - bring anything tasty and share it.
