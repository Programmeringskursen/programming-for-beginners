1. Make a function that draws the map (and the objects/players in rooms)
  * Note that you can use any plotting library you know, or even draw it using text if that's easier for you :)
  * You need to decide what to draw for each room
    * Can be as basic as just a square
    * Can include text description / name
    * Can include who is in the room
3. Make the player able to give objects to NPCs/monsters/Ove
4. Make NPCs/monsters/Ove move (randomly, or based on a plan or some rule) each time the player moves
5. Make NPCs/monsters/Ove drop what they carry at random or based on some rule (i.e. not being in the same room as the player)
6. Make doors that only work if you're carrying a certain object (e.g. the right key)
