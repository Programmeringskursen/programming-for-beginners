* Make a function that draws the map (and the objects/players in rooms)
* Make the player able to give objects to NPCs/monsters/Ove
* Make NPCs/monsters/Ove move (randomly, or based on a plan or some rule) each time the player moves
* Make NPCs/monsters/Ove drop what they carry at random or based on some rule (i.e. not being in the same room as the player)
* Make doors that only work if you're carrying a certain object (e.g. the right key)
