# Some general notes on philosophy

* We want to teach programming to people who have never programmed
* Our goal is not to teach people to become professional programmers eventually, but to be able to build functional programs now
* Teach how to use a single tool for multiple problems if at all possible.
  * At this stage, everything really is a nail, give them a hammer.
  * Do not teach multiple ways to do the same thing.
* We only teach object oriented solutions; everything is an object; methods, not functions
* You are going to say instance, object, class, type, etc by mistake, accept that things have multiple names and just tell them!
